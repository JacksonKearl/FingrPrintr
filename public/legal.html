			<h3>Data & Privacy</h3>
			<p>
				There are a couple cookies, one that maintains your name, one
				that caches your browser fingerprint. These are both necessary
				for the app to function, thus no cookie banner.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you enter a room, your name is published to the room via
				the welcome message. This message, and any you send, are stored
				by Cloudflare and accessible to the world at large. The most
				recent 100 messages in each room are maintained indefinitely.
			</p>
			<p>
				Deleting information is not possible to the public at large, but
				can be requested by contacting me via email (available on

			<h3>Tracking</h3>
			<p>
				This site uses
				<a
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/"
				>
					Cloudflare Web Analytics
				</a>
				to track performance and usage. Users are not tracked at an
				individual level.
