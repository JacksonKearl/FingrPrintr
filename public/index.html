			<h4>What?</h4>
			<p>
				A social network where you chat with people who have an
				identical
				<a
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					href="https://www.amiunique.org/fp"
					>browser fingerprint</a
				>
				to your own
			</p>
			<h4>Why?</h4>
			<p>It seemed fun</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to try my hand at making a webapp that doesn't need
				JavaScript but still acts dynamic (this site will still work
				with JS disabled!)
			</p>
			<p>
				I've long suspected browser fingerprints aren't as unique as
				some sites claim (how many M1 Macbook Airs are out there? iPhone
				12's?), perhaps this will validate that
			</p>
			<h4>How?</h4>
			<p>
				When JavaScript is enabled, fingerprinting works based on
				<a
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs"
					>fingerprintjs's</a
				>
				algorithm; this measures things like your system preferences,
				browser configuration, monitor settings, and details of your
				video and audio chips
			</p>
			<p>
				When JavaScript is disabled, fingerprinting happens exclusively
				on the server via request headers - there are some techniques to
				fingerprint more intensely without JavaScript, for instance via
				CSS queries, but I have not implemented those here
			</p>
			<p>
				I made some changes to make the fingerprints more stable, for
				instance discarding timezone info and exact browser version
				numbers
