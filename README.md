# FingrPrintr: The Internet's Loneliest Social Network

https://fingrprintr.pages.dev/

FingrPrintr is a social network that places you in a chatroom with others sharing your same browser fingerprint.

Sites like [panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/results?aat=1#fingerprintTable) like to show you big scary results saying that your browser fingerprint is mega unique, but I just don't believe them. I think there have to be a decent number of other people like me, who use basically the same browser, hardware, plugins, fonts, etc. as a bunch of other people.

So I devised this application, which gives each fingerprint a unique "chatroom" that other sharers of the same fingerprint can communicate in. Perhaps my theory is totally wrong and everyone will be placed in a solitary room. But perhaps it isn't, in which case we might be able to be a bit less worried about the big scary world of fingerprinting.
